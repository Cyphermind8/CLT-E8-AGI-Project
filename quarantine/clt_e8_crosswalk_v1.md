# CLT–E8 Crosswalk (v1, Ultrathink)

This file explicitly binds the three tiers of the project:

- **CLT–E8 Evolved Paper** — physics derivations, equations, predictions.
- **Theory Mapping (v1)** — detailed translation into data structures, algorithms, and control flows.
- **Master Instructions** — governance rules, milestones, and coding standards.

By aligning physics → architecture → governance, we ensure no concept drifts unanchored.

## 1. Coherence Integral ( \( \mathcal{C} = \int \psi_1^* \psi_2 dV \) )

- **Paper**  
  Defines coherence as overlap of quantum states; foundation of memory and stability.  

- **Theory Mapping**  
  → Section 2.1: Implemented as `coherence_score()` with components: ΔEntropy, Consistency, Contradictions.  
  → Normalized [0,1]; tunable λ, γ.  

- **Master Instructions**  
  → Planner must rank plans by Coherence.  
  → Success metric: Coherence–success correlation ≥ 0.6 by Month 3.

---

## 2. Phase Slips (Topological Invariants)

- **Paper**  
  Slips encode memory as robust invariants; operators \( \hat{S}_i = e^{i\theta_i T_{\alpha_i}} \).  

- **Theory Mapping**  
  → SlipStates = immutable DAG nodes with provenance + heads.  
  → Slip operator → embedding phase rotations for pruning.  

- **Master Instructions**  
  → Workspace + ledger committed by Week 2.  
  → Metric: no in-place mutation allowed; full provenance preserved.

---

## 3. E8 Lattice Structure

- **Paper**  
  E8 chosen for symmetry decomposition; dynamic slips filter mirror states; QEC substrate.  

- **Theory Mapping**  
  → Multi-head embeddings (8–16).  
  → Retrieval = per-head search + consensus.  
  → Acts as cognitive QEC.  

- **Master Instructions**  
  → Ablation: E8 multi-head must outperform single-head by +10% accuracy or −20% latency.  
  → Deadline: Month 1 demo.

---

## 4. Tanh Potential ( \( V(\mathcal{C}) = \Lambda (1 - \tanh(k \mathcal{C}))^2 \) )

- **Paper**  
  Derived from topological entropy + multi-loop RG flows.  
  Ensures stability, avoids divergences.  

- **Theory Mapping**  
  → Planner uses g = tanh(k·u) to gate exploration breadth vs consolidation.  

- **Master Instructions**  
  → Tanh gate integration required by Month 3 milestone.  
  → Config param: `tanh_k` in default.yaml.

---

## 5. Truth Maintenance (Contradictions)

- **Paper**  
  Retrocausality + coherence anchoring imply contradictions must be dynamically resolved.  

- **Theory Mapping**  
  → TMS: tracks assumptions/justifications/facts.  
  → Conflicts → phase penalties (reduce retrieval weight).  

- **Master Instructions**  
  → By Month 3, system must auto-revise failed plans using TMS.  
  → Metric: ≥70% contradiction resolution.

---

## 6. Chirality Selection

- **Paper**  
  Slip operators dynamically phase out mirror fermions in E8 → SM decomposition.  

- **Theory Mapping**  
  → Analog: repeated slip penalties prune unsupported beliefs.  
  → Survivors = “chiral” stable facts.  

- **Master Instructions**  
  → Require belief revision loop: unsupported beliefs fade after repeated failures.  
  → Implemented in TMS by Month 6.

---

## 7. Observational Predictions (Paper → Software Analogues)

- **Gravitational wave echoes (1387 Hz, 10–30 ms)**  
  ↔ Test agent’s “echo memory”: retrieval consistency over long trajectories.  

- **Casimir drift (0.4–0.6 ppm)**  
  ↔ Measure subtle coherence score drifts across repeated runs; falsifiable micro-sensitivity.  

- **PTA modulations (1% nanohertz)**  
  ↔ Long-horizon coherence oscillations in planning loops.  

These predictions inspire stress tests for AGI memory & stability.

---

## 8. Quantum Error Correction (QEC)

- **Paper**  
  E8 lattice functions as topological QEC; slips surpass Bravyi–König bounds.  

- **Theory Mapping**  
  → Multi-head consensus retrieval = cognitive QEC analogue.  
  → Procedural skills redundantly stored.  

- **Master Instructions**  
  → Ablation: with vs without consensus retrieval.  
  → Target: consensus retrieval must reduce error rate ≥20%.

---

## 9. Safety and Rails

- **Paper**  
  Retrocausality and coherence anchoring stress stability; UV completion prevents divergence.  

- **Theory Mapping**  
  → Sandbox + logs; bounded learning rates; prevent runaway beliefs.  

- **Master Instructions**  
  → Explicit: sandbox ON, logging mandatory, no network writes.  
  → These are rails for reproducibility, not censorship.

# Summary

- **Paper → Physics**: defines coherence field, slips, tanh potential, E8 lattice, falsifiable predictions.  
- **Theory Mapping → Software**: operationalizes them into SlipStates, multi-head embeddings, phase-gated retrieval, coherence score, TMS, planner.  
- **Master Instructions → Governance**: codifies deliverables, timelines, metrics, and rails.  

Together, these three tiers form a **closed coherence loop**: theory grounds architecture, architecture obeys governance, governance measures theory.
