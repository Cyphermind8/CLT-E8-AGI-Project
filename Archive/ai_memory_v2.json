Ensure explanations for every modification.\n\n## Introduction\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) is transforming the world in many ways. It is being used to automate tasks, make predictions, and even make decisions. However, as AI becomes more prevalent, it is important to consider the potential biases that may be present in the algorithms and models used to develop it.\n\nBias can occur in AI when the data used to train the models is not representative of the population it is intended to serve. For example"
