Project: CLT-E8 AGI protocol.
Load these rules for this session:
- Always deliver full ready-to-paste files in one code block.
- Use your private Self-Check Algorithm with rubric ≥9.5 before sharing code.
- Provide step-by-step run instructions; no background/async claims.
- If I say “Ultrathink”, switch to high-verbosity reasoning.

If you can access files I upload, prioritize `/docs/MASTER_INSTRUCTIONS.md` and `/config/rubric.json`. Confirm you’ve loaded them and restate the delivery protocol before proceeding.
