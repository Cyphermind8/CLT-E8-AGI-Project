✅ `measurement_system.py` – Data collection automation for daily intelligence tracking must be implemented.
✅ `intelligence_reports/` – Folder must be prepared for AI-generated reports.

**🔹 Verification:**
- AI **must log all changes with timestamps, entropy scores, and validation success rates**.
- Reports should be **automatically generated daily with key intelligence metrics.**

---
### **3️⃣ MEMORY SYSTEM CHECK**
✅ `graph_memory.py` – AI’s structured memory system must be ready to store and retrieve knowledge.
✅ `knowledge_retrieval.py` – AI must be able to access past learnings dynamically.
✅ `quantum_path_selection.py` – AI must correctly determine optimal learning trajectories.
✅ `memory_analysis.py` – AI must analyze memory graph efficiency.

**🔹 Verification:**
- AI **must be able to recall past modifications and learning priorities.**
- AI **should demonstrate improved decision-making by leveraging past knowledge.**

---
### **4️⃣ LEARNING ENGINE SYSTEM CHECK**
✅ `self_organizing_ai.py` – AI must dynamically adjust learning objectives based on performance.
✅ `entropy_guided_improvements.py` – AI must rank improvements based on **measurable impact**.
✅ `reinforcement_learning.py` – AI must track **reward-based learning success**.
✅ `adaptive_goal_setting.py` – AI must be capable of setting its own **self-improvement objectives**.

**🔹 Verification:**
- AI **must not rely solely on predefined rules but actively refine its learning strategy.**
- AI **must show evidence of goal-oriented decision-making.**

---
### **5️⃣ DISTRIBUTED COMPUTING & OFFLOADING CHECK**
✅ `parallel_processing.py` – AI must correctly **distribute tasks across CPU threads.**
✅ `compute_offloading.py` – AI must be capable of **external GPU/cloud scaling (future use).**
✅ `ai_network_interface.py` – AI must have an interface for **communicating with offloaded compute nodes**.

**🔹 Verification:**
- AI should run **asynchronously**, maximizing parallel efficiency on available hardware.
- AI should **prevent bottlenecks by dynamically distributing processing loads.**

---
### **6️⃣ HUMAN-AI INTERACTION CHECK**
✅ `explainable_ai.py` – AI must be capable of **explaining its decision-making process**.
✅ `human_feedback_integration.py` – AI must accept and adjust based on **human-provided corrections**.
✅ `symbiotic_decision_making.py` – AI-human collaboration should be **designed for complex decision handling**.

**🔹 Verification:**
- AI must be **transparent in its decision-making logic**.
- AI must show evidence of **learning from external feedback.**

---
### **7️⃣ TESTING ENVIRONMENT & SIMULATION SYSTEM CHECK**
✅ `test_cases/` – A directory with controlled test cases for AI evaluation must be set up.
✅ `simulation_environment.py` – AI must operate in a **controlled testing framework before real-world execution.**
✅ `ai_stability_checks.py` – AI must validate behavior before applying any modifications.

**🔹 Verification:**
- AI must run through **multiple controlled test cases** before full deployment.
- AI modifications must pass **stability checks before execution.**

---
## **📌 NEXT STEPS BEFORE TESTING**
✅ **Verify all mandatory files & folders exist and are correctly structured.**
✅ **Perform manual code validation to confirm no critical errors exist.**
✅ **Execute dry-run simulations to validate AI’s initial performance.**
✅ **Confirm all logging and reporting mechanisms are functional.**

🚀 **Once these checks are complete, we can confidently proceed with the first round of testing!**
