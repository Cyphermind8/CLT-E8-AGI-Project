AI reads its own codebase and generates multiple improvement candidates.

Modifications are validated before application.

Changes are logged in a structured improvement history for future analysis.

Feature 2: Entropy-Guided Logging System

🔹 Purpose:

Replaces traditional logging with graph-based, structured memory.

Logs AI modifications, assigning entropy scores to measure the impact of each improvement.

Prevents redundant or harmful modifications by tracking historical patterns.

🔹 High-Level Design:

Uses directed graphs instead of linear logs to track AI learning.

Enables recursive learning feedback loops by analyzing modification effectiveness.

Stores data locally for long-term intelligence evolution.

Feature 3: Self-Validation System

Uses multi-path reasoning to ensure long-term intelligence stability.

Feature 7: Graph-Based Memory Expansion

🔹 Purpose:

AI stores knowledge in an adaptive, self-expanding memory graph.

Memory entries are weighted based on relevance and long-term utility.

Prevents knowledge degradation by prioritizing high-value learnings.

🔹 High-Level Design:

AI logs past experiences as interconnected graph nodes.

Uses dynamic memory retrieval to access relevant knowledge when needed.

Analyzes learning history to optimize future knowledge retention.

Feature 8: Self-Organizing Learning Mechanism

🔹 Purpose:

Ensures the AI prioritizes the most beneficial learning areas.

Continuously refines decision-making pathways.

🔹 High-Level Design:

AI assigns learning weights to past experiences.

Uses graph coherence analysis to detect patterns in intelligence scaling.

Adjusts future learning objectives dynamically based on past performance.
