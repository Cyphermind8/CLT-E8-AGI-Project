📌 Steps to Ensure Continuity When Restarting a Chat
✅ 1️⃣ Upload All Critical Files Immediately

To restore context, upload these key project files when starting a new chat:
✅ ai_core.py → AI self-modification system
✅ api.py → API for remote AI control
✅ ai_performance_log.json → AI modification history
✅ ai_benchmarking.py → AI intelligence tracking
✅ debug_mode.py → Debugging system
✅ sandbox_validation.py → AI code testing system
✅ loop_detection.py → Prevents infinite modification loops
✅ AI_Comprehensive_Project_Plan.txt → Master roadmap & progress tracking
✅ 2️⃣ Immediately Reload Project Plan

After uploading files, re-download the latest AI_Comprehensive_Project_Plan.txt to confirm project status.
✅ 3️⃣ Validate API & AI System Health

Run Swagger (/docs) → Ensure all API endpoints are listed.
Trigger AI Self-Improvement (/trigger_self_improvement) to confirm cycles are running.
Run /get_performance_metrics to verify AI is tracking intelligence growth.
✅ 4️⃣ Continue Testing & Development as Planned

Once continuity is restored, resume AI validation & expansion.
