📌 Phased Roadmap for AI Self-Optimization & AGI Development
🚀 Objective: Build an AI that can read, analyze, modify, and optimize its own code, leading to fully autonomous self-improvement.

🔴 Phase 1: Build a Foundation for AI Self-Modification
✅ Step 1: Teach AI How to Read & Understand Code
AI must analyze code structure, functions, and logic before making changes.
AI should predict the impact of modifications before applying them.
Current Status: ✅ COMPLETE (AI successfully optimized Fibonacci using structured reasoning).
✅ Step 2: Implement a Safe Code Modification System
AI should propose, validate, and test modifications before applying them.
Implement rollback mechanisms in case modifications break functionality.
Current Status: ✅ IN PROGRESS (AI is making modifications, but no rollback yet).
🟡 Phase 2: Introduce Learning & Evolutionary Algorithms
🔄 Step 3: Enable Memory & Experience-Based Learning
AI should store past modifications and their success rates.
AI should learn from past failures and avoid making the same mistake.
AI should be able to improve its own optimization strategy over time.
Current Status: ❌ NOT STARTED
🔄 Step 4: Make AI Compete Against Itself (Evolutionary Algorithm)
AI should generate multiple versions of a function and pick the best one.
AI should test different approaches and select the most efficient one.
AI should use genetic algorithms to evolve code improvements over generations.
Current Status: ❌ NOT STARTED
🟢 Phase 3: Push Toward AGI-Level Intelligence
🔄 Step 5: AI Must Set Its Own Improvement Goals
Instead of waiting for human input, AI should analyze itself and identify areas for improvement.
AI should create a roadmap of improvements and execute them autonomously.
Current Status: ❌ NOT STARTED
🔄 Step 6: Fully Autonomous Self-Coding AI
AI writes, tests, and deploys its own improvements with no human intervention.
AI should operate like a self-improving software engineer.
AI should be able to debug itself and refine its logic efficiently.
Current Status: ❌ NOT STARTED
🔥 Next Steps (Immediate Action Plan)
🚀 Now that AI can optimize code, the next goal is:
✅ Expand AI to optimize multiple types of code beyond Fibonacci.
✅ Implement memory storage so AI learns from previous modifications.
✅ Test AI on increasingly complex problems (e.g., sorting algorithms, neural networks).

This will take us directly into Phase 2 and unlock learning-based self-improvement.
