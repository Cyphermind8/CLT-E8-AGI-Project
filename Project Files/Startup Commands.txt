✅ Step 4: Start FastAPI Server
uvicorn api:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000

📌 Access API:

Swagger UI: http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs

🌐 For External Network Access (Allowing Other Devices to Connect)
uvicorn 

📌 Find Your Local IP:
Run this to get your IP address:
ipconfig
Look for "IPv4 Address" (e.g., 192.168.1.100).
Use this IP in your browser:

http://192.168.1.100:8000/docs
📌 If blocked: Open Windows Firewall and allow Uvicorn through.

✅ Step 5: Verify API is Running
Once the API is running, open:

Local: http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs
External: http://192.168.X.X:8000/docs

✅ If Swagger UI loads, API is working!
❌ If errors appear, let me know!

🔥 Next Steps
This startup process must be repeated every time after a restart.
